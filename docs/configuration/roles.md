## Domain-Role-Relationship

To ensure that a requester can only request objects with the corresponding roles. We have introduced a relationship between domain and roles. We do this simply by following a consistent group path.
For example, a user must be a member of the group `domain-read` and `TestStudie`, which is a child of `domain-read`. This creates the path `domain-read/TestStudie`, which ensures that the domain `TestStudie` can be read.
